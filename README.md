# UrbanSound8k
dataset = (https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)
## Intro
This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner,
car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.
The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. For a detailed description of the dataset and how it was compiled please refer to our paper.
All excerpts are taken from field recordings uploaded to (www.freesound.org). The files are pre-sorted into ten folds (folders named fold1-fold10) 
to help in the reproduction of and comparison with the automatic classification results reported in the article above.
In addition to the sound excerpts, a CSV file containing metadata about each excerpt is also provided. 
## 
In this project, I used the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset, the sounds of city. I did a project on classification. My purpose in this project's preparing an artificial intelligence model using deep learning algorithms.
